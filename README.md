 Allowing AI to improve itself

Simply - Reasoning Framework based on Engineering Design Cycle

## Engineering Design Process

### 1. Define Needs and Constraints
- Identify the task's needs and clarify constraints.
- Create a list of clarifications based on task-specific goals.

### 2. Research the Problem
- Use multiple sources, including:
  - Search engines to compile relevant information.
  - External media platforms for inspiration (e.g., X).
  
### 4. Create Initial Design
- Set up a plan and begin creating a prototype roadmap and how it will work.
- Develop a model for user testing and feedback.
- passing onto worker agents to execute

### 3. Worker Agents
- Best in the certain topic and only focused on getting it done
- Compiler, Final step of working stage should be compilation (having an agent compile might deviate from its focus on given topic resulting in example files and so on being used)

### 5. Testing and Feedback
- Establish a tester AI that:
  - Understands the architecture.
  - Tests all components thoroughly.
- Collect feedback through structured questions and analyze responses.

### ??. Develop Benchmarks
- A goal for Evo to read its own code and create its own develop benchmarks section

## Tools and Resources

- **Research Platforms:**
  - Perplexity
  - Google Scholar
  - Semantic Scholar
  - DuckDuckGo (greatest free API)

- **Clustering Information:**
  - Categorize and prioritize based on context.
  - Use clustering algorithms to organize data efficiently.

## Notes on AI Integration
- The AI should:
  - Be adaptable to evolving architectures.
  - Take feedback from users and adjust design accordingly to not waste any steps
